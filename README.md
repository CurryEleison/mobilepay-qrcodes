# MobilePay QR Code Generator

This is a small React app to generate QR codes for MobilePay payments. 

If you want to receive funds from someone, just type in your phone/MobilePay number
and optionally a currency amount, and ask people to point their camera at your screen.

There's no backend and you don't need to have MobilePay installed to use it.
